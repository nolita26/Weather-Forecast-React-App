# Weather-Forecast-React-App
Built a weather map web-app that allows users to view the current weather conditions—such as sunny, cloudy, rainy, or snowy—for any city they search.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created with [Create React App]:

### `npm create-react-app weather-app`
### `cd weather-app`

Install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies:

### `npm install tailwindcss`

Install Axios to make HTTP requests:

### `npm install axios`

Install React Map GL:

### `npm install react-map-gl`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Run the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project to have complete access.
